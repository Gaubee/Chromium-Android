  <!-- <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsDesc">Enables Chromium\'s restricted log in feature in G Suite and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you define this setting, the user will only be able to access Google
Apps using accounts from the specified domains (note that to allow
gmail.com/googlemail.com accounts, you should add \\&quot;consumer_accounts\\&quot;
(without quotes) to the list of domains).

This setting will prevent the user from logging in, and adding a Secondary
Account, on a managed device that requires Google authentication, if that
account does not belong to the aforementioned list of allowed domains.

If you leave this setting empty/not-configured, the user will be able to
access G Suite with any account.

This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to
all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in

  <!-- <string name="BrowserSigninTitle">Browser sign in settings</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="BrowserSigninDesc">This policy controls the sign-in behavior of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Chromium with their account and use account related services like Chrome sync.

If the policy is set to \\&quot;Disable browser sign-in\\&quot; then the user can not sign in to the browser and use account based services. In this case browser level features like Chrome sync can not be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set \\&quot;Disabled\\&quot; they will be signed out the next time they run Chrome but their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will stay preserved. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

If the policy is set to \\&quot;Enable browser sign-in,\\&quot; then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user\'s account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome sync, use the \\&quot;SyncDisabled\\&quot; policy.

If the policy is set to \\&quot;Force browser sign-in\\&quot; the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the \\&quot;SyncDisabled\\&quot; policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556.

If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable the browser sign in option and use it as they see fit.</string> -->

  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate\'s subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server\'s certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\&quot;/\\&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \\&quot;sha256\\&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Chromium, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Chromium OS.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\&quot;/\\&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \\&quot;sha256\\&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string> -->
  <!-- <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs.

This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string> -->

internal web development so that their developers can test out features
requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled
\\&quot;Not Secure\\&quot; in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
command-line flag \'\-\-unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure\' to a

If the policy is set to \\&quot;Enable browser sign-in,\\&quot; then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user\'s account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome sync, use the \\&quot;SyncDisabled\\&quot; policy.

If the policy is set to \\&quot;Force browser sign-in\\&quot; the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the \\&quot;SyncDisabled\\&quot; policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556. This option does not support Linux and Android, it will fallback to \\&quot;Enable browser sign-in\\&quot; if used.

If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable the browser sign in option and use it as they see fit.</string>

  <string name="BuiltInDnsClientEnabledDesc">This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the Operating System DNS client, or Chromium\'s built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Chromium will always use the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the DnsOverHttpsMode policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

If this policy is set to Enabled, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available.

If this policy is set to Disabled, the built-in DNS client will only be used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.

If this policy is left unset, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on macOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and Chromium OS.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasDesc">Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn\'t be trusted (because they weren\'t properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the hash must meet one of these conditions:

* It\'s of the server certificate\'s subjectPublicKeyInfo.

* It\'s of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the certificate chain. That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute.

* It\'s of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server\'s certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren\'t disclosed, then Chromium doesn\'t trust those certificates.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasDesc">Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities (CA) for certificate chains with a specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hash. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn\'t be trusted (because they weren\'t properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the subjectPublicKeyInfo hash must appear in a CA certificate recognized as a Legacy CA. A Legacy CA is publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by Chromium, but not Android Open Source Project or Chromium OS.

Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsDesc">Setting the policy turns off Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for the hostnames in the specified URLs.

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren\'t disclosed, then Chromium doesn\'t trust those certificates.

A URL pattern follows this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). However, because the validity of certificates for a given hostname is independent of the scheme, port, or path, Chromium only considers the hostname portion of the URL. Wildcard hosts aren\'t supported.</string>

If this policy is left unset then the feature will be controlled by its
own internal logic, which can be manually configured by users.

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent
value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full
restart is required to ensure that all loaded tabs receive a consistent
policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different
values of this policy.

  <string name="IsolateOriginsAndroidTitle">Enable Site Isolation for specified origins on Android devices</string>
  <string name="IsolateOriginsAndroidDesc">Setting the policy means each of the named origins in a comma-separated list runs in its own process, and it isolates origins named by subdomains. For example, specifying https://example.com/ isolates https://foo.example.com/ as part of the https://example.com/ site.

Turning the policy off prevents explicit site isolation and turns off field trials of IsolateOriginsAndroid and SitePerProcessAndroid. Users can still turn on IsolateOrigins manually, through the command line flag.

Leaving the policy unset lets users change this setting.

Note: Site isolation support for Android will improve, but currently it may cause performance problems. This policy applies only to Chrome on Android running on devices with strictly more than 1 GB of RAM. To apply the policy on non-Android platforms, use IsolateOrigins.</string>
  <string name="JavaScriptAllowedForUrlsTitle">Allow JavaScript on these sites</string>
  <string name="JavaScriptAllowedForUrlsDesc">Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that specify the sites that can run JavaScript.

Leaving the policy unset means DefaultJavaScriptSetting applies for all sites, if it\'s set. If not, the user\'s personal setting applies.

  <string name="LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledTitle">Default legacy SameSite cookie behavior setting</string>
  <string name="LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledDesc">Allows you to revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don\'t specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were \\&quot;SameSite=None\\&quot;, removes the requirement for \\&quot;SameSite=None\\&quot; cookies to carry the \\&quot;Secure\\&quot; attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site. See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies for full description.

When this policy is not set, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on the user\'s personal configuration for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature which may be set by a field trial or by enabling or disabling the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag, respectively.</string>

Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don\'t specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were \\&quot;SameSite=None\\&quot;, removes the requirement for \\&quot;SameSite=None\\&quot; cookies to carry the \\&quot;Secure\\&quot; attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site. See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies for full description.

For cookies on domains not covered by the patterns specified here, or for all cookies if this policy is not set, the global default value will be used either from the LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled policy, if it is set, or the user\'s personal configuration otherwise.

Note that patterns you list here are treated as domains, not URLs, so you should not specify a scheme or port.</string>
  <string name="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomainsTitle">Suppress lookalike domain warnings on domains</string>
  <string name="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomainsDesc">This policy prevents the display of lookalike URL warnings on the sites listed. These warnings are typically shown on sites that Chromium believes might be trying to spoof another site the user is familiar with.

If the policy is enabled and set to one or more domains, no lookalike warnings pages will be shown when the user visits pages on that domain.

If the policy is disabled, not set, or set to an empty list, warnings may appear on any site the user visits.

A hostname can be allowed with a complete host match, or any domain match. For example, a URL like \\&quot;https://foo.example.com/bar\\&quot; may have warnings suppressed if this list includes either \\&quot;foo.example.com\\&quot; or \\&quot;example.com\\&quot;.</string>
  <string name="ManagedBookmarksTitle">Managed Bookmarks</string>
  <string name="ManagedBookmarksDesc">Setting the policy sets up a list of bookmarks where each one is a dictionary with the keys \\&quot;name\\&quot; and \\&quot;url\\&quot;. These keys hold the bookmark\'s name and target. Admins can set up a subfolder by defining a bookmark without a \\&quot;url\\&quot; key, but with an additional \\&quot;children\\&quot; key. This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, \\&quot;google.com\\&quot; becomes \\&quot;https://google.com/\\&quot;.

Users can\'t change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is \\&quot;Managed bookmarks\\&quot; but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named \\&quot;toplevel_name\\&quot; with the desired folder name as its value. Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and extensions can\'t modify them.</string>
  <string name="NTPContentSuggestionsEnabledTitle">Show content suggestions on the New Tab page</string>

  <string name="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOriginTitle">Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on
insecure origins should not apply</string>
  <string name="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOriginDesc">Setting the policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as *.example.com) for which security restrictions on insecure origins won\'t apply. Organizations can specify origins for legacy applications that can\'t deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development, so developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled \\&quot;Not Secure\\&quot; in the address bar.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. The policy overrides the command-line flag and UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

For more information on secure contexts, see Secure Contexts ( https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts ).</string>
  <string name="PasswordLeakDetectionEnabledTitle">Enable leak detection for entered credentials</string>

   * ProxyPacUrl, a URL to a proxy .pac file
   * ProxyServer, a URL of the proxy server
   * ProxyBypassList, a list of proxy hosts that Chromium bypasses

 The ProxyServerMode field is deprecated in favor of the ProxyMode field, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

  For ProxyMode, if you choose the value:
    * direct, a proxy is never used and all other fields are ignored.
    * system, the systems\'s proxy is used and all other fields are ignored.

Use it to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths, using the format specified at ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The URLAllowlist policy takes precedence over URLBlocklist. This policy is limited to 1,000 entries.

This policy also allows enabling the automatic invocation by the browser of external application registered as protocol handlers for the listed protocols like \\&quot;tel:\\&quot; or \\&quot;ssh:\\&quot;.

Leaving the policy unset allows no exceptions to URLBlocklist.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

Up to 1,000 exceptions can be defined in URLAllowlist.

From Chromium version 73, you can block javascript://* URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript entered in the address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). In-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data aren\'t subject to this policy. For example, if you block example.com/abc, then example.com can still load example.com/abc using XMLHTTPRequest.

  <string name="WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrlsDesc">Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

The USB permission model uses the requesting and embedding URLs to grant the requesting URL permission to access the USB device. The requesting URL can be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. So, the urls field can have up to 2 URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL, respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices is granted when the requesting site\'s URL matches this URL, regardless of embedding status. The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting applies, if it\'s set. If not, the user\'s personal setting applies.
